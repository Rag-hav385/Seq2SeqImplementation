Encoder-Decoder Machine Translation Model
This code implements an Encoder-Decoder model for machine translation tasks. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras and is designed to translate text from one language to another. Specifically, it takes an input sequence in the source language and generates the corresponding translation in the target language.

Components of the Model
1. Encoder
The Encoder class represents the encoder part of the model. It takes the following parameters during initialization:

inp_vocab_size: The size of the input vocabulary (number of unique words).
embedding_size: The dimension of word embeddings.
lstm_size: The number of LSTM units in the encoder.
input_length: The length of the input sequences.
The encoder consists of an embedding layer followed by an LSTM layer. The embedding layer converts input sequences into dense vectors, and the LSTM layer processes these vectors to capture contextual information. The call method of the encoder takes an input sequence and initial states as input and returns the LSTM outputs, the last time step's hidden state, and the last time step's cell state.

2. Attention Mechanism
The Attention class represents the attention mechanism used in the model. It is responsible for calculating attention scores based on different scoring functions, such as dot, general, or concat. The attention mechanism helps the model focus on relevant parts of the input sequence when generating each word in the translation.

3. One-Step Decoder
The One_Step_Decoder class represents the decoder for a single time step. It takes the following parameters during initialization:

tar_vocab_size: The size of the target vocabulary (number of unique words).
embedding_dim: The dimension of word embeddings.
input_length: The length of the input sequences.
dec_units: The number of LSTM units in the decoder.
score_fun: The scoring function used in the attention mechanism.
att_units: The number of units for scoring function computations.
The one-step decoder takes an input token, encoder outputs, and decoder states as input and produces the next token in the translation sequence. It also calculates attention weights for the input sequence at each time step.

4. Decoder
The Decoder class represents the decoder part of the model. It takes the same parameters as the one-step decoder but creates multiple one-step decoder instances to decode the entire sequence. The decoder is responsible for generating the translation sequence word by word. It utilizes teacher forcing during training.

5. Encoder-Decoder Model
The encoder_decoder class combines the encoder and decoder to create the complete machine translation model. It takes various parameters, including embedding sizes, LSTM units, and batch size. The model is trained to minimize a custom loss function that considers the loss only for non-padded tokens.

Training
The training process involves feeding both the source and target sequences to the model. Teacher forcing is used during training to improve convergence. The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and a custom loss function. Training progress can be monitored using TensorBoard.

Inference
To perform translation inference, you can use the predict function. It takes an input sentence in the source language and the trained model as input and returns the translated sentence in the target language. It also provides attention plots to visualize which parts of the source sentence the model pays attention to during translation.

Usage
You can use this code to build and train machine translation models for various language pairs. Adjust the model parameters and training settings as needed for your specific task.
